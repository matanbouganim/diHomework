// 	In this exercises, you have to decide which type of variables you have to use
// 1. Create a global variable that saves the amount of money you have in your account
// 2. Create a variable that saves the % of VAT (In Israel, itâ€™s 17%)
// 3. Create an array with all the expenses and revenu you did /received for the past last month (the revenu start with a +, the expenses start with a - )
// 4. Create a code that multiplies the expenses by the VAT, in order to include the taxes
// 5. Create a code that modifies the global amount of the money you have in your account depending on your expenses/revenu of the month
// 6. Display it 

const account = []
let vat = .17
let accountActivity = [+23, -34, -3423, 
+2345, -3467 , -56762, +34523,]

function CalculateTaxes(expenses){
	console.log(expenses * vat)
}

CalculateTaxes(forEach(accountActivity < 0)? accountActivity* vat : console.log("problem");
